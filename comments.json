        "Comment": "Thanks a lot for this video sir ...\nI just want to know is my understanding correct or incorrect\nBasically ,we use Lagrange method  in order to find a maximum or minimum value of a particular function in the specific domain(constraint). In the f(x,y) function we are trying to find the max and min points in such a way that they are present in the domain g(x,y) . I have placed f(x,y) graph onto the g(x,y) graph so that i can actually find out the points that are present on both the curves .y only on the curves is because its the boundary... Max and min is possible at boundary only..any points that are present out of boundaries are not taken into consideration as it wont follow the constraint.when we try to draw the normal to these curves f(x,y) and g(x,y) they will obviously be  multiple of one another. We are actually doing the partial derivation for both the curves the resulting partial derivation are actually multiple of each other.\nPls let me know if i am wrong..",

I took the full video waiting for it, and realized at the very end that it would not be discussed.\n\nThe title is deceiving. It's not talking about the Lagrange multipliers, it's talking about the method of Lagrange multipliers.",

        "Comment": "The solution procedure may be simplified, if lambda is eliminated in the first two equations giving y^2-x^2=0 (multiply equ. 1 by y, equ. 2 by x, subtract equ. 2 from equ. 1), as generally proposed by MathePeter. Then replace x^2 by y^2 (or vice versa) in the third equation finally giving the set of the 2nd solution. The advantage is that lambda is not needed to be determined and the spurious first solution does not appear.",

        "Comment": "Hello Dr. Trefor.. this Lagrange multiplier was bugging me for a while till i found your channel.. This is the first time i actually i understand what this is about.. However, I stumbled on it while studying finance Portfolio optimization (you know, Markowitz and stuff like that), where it's not just x and y variables but many more.. \nI also stumbled on a paper where the Lagrange multiplier is explained differently by constructing a new function out of the initial function and the constraint function.. Something like:\nF(x,y) = f(x,y) + lamda . g (x,y)\nSo if i may put this as requests:\nA video about the Lagrange multiplier with more than 2 variables\nA video about the Lagrange multiplier about the solution of the constraint problem by constructing a third function. I can send the paper i found online about the latter case if you Dr. find it interesting enough to make those videos..\nA final note: For economists and finance people, understanding this is absolutely necessary for their studies.. Without a background in math it took me a long time to finally find this channel.. Addressing those 2 points would be a huge service to so many people..",

I've been looking at these Lagrange explanations for years and yours is approximately the best. I love your graphics and your explanation. (Maybe the audio could be a bit better.)  If anyone is curious as to a real-life application of this type of solution, think about a consumer that has a budget constraint of, say, $12,000 / year to spend on either food (f) or clothing (c) and the utility U they derive from that food and clothing is given by U = f * c + 1. Their (budget) constraint is the line given by $12000 = (Pf)(f) + (Pc)(c). This method helps us find the combination of food and clothing that maximizes the consumers utility given their budget constraint. Yay!  :)",

        "Comment": "Please note that using Lagrange Multipliers DOES NOT TURN A CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM IN AN UNCONSTRAINED ONE. The \"maximum of the function\" is not really a maximum of f(x, y). The \"maximum\" is the maximally attainable value of the constrained function. However, if you look at the Lagrangian being a function of x,y, lambda at the optimal point its more often a saddle point. There is a really nice article by Dan Kalman called \"Leveling with Lagrange: An Alternate View of Constrained Optimization\" that goes into more detail on what would be a correct interpretation to Lagrange multiplier optimization.",

By the third equation, it follows immediately that \u03bb\u00b2 = 1/4. Then, proceed the same as before.",

        "Comment": "This is not the way I have usually thought about it but it's equivalent.  The way I've usually thought about it is that you imagine walking along the constraint and observing the gradient of f as you go.  If the gradient of f has any component along the constraint, it means you can keep walking along the constraint and get higher (or lower) values of f, since the directional derivative is just the component of gradf(f) along the direction you're moving.  Therefor you keep walking around the constraint until you reach a point where the gradient of f is normal to the constraint, since at this point f is instantaneously not changing.  To me this is more intuitive than thinking the level curve of f should be tangent to the constraint, even though the gradient of f being normal to the constraint IS the level curve being tangent to it.  Different strokes I guess.",

        "Comment": "@Dr. Trefor Bazett \u00a0@Dr. Trefor Bazett\u00a0 thank you for your reply Dr Bazett. If I understand you correctly, I should treat g as a function of x and y, i.e. g(x,y) = z = x^2+y^2, which is effectively a parabolloid. Hence the gradient of g is [dz/dx , dz/dy], which will then be normal to the circle at every value of z. \nWhereas I was previously thinking that g was the function x^2+y^2=1 which is just a circle, and if I take its derivative, it's not the gradient of the parabolloid but rather the derivative of the position vector of any point of the circle's circumference.",

If the extremum is an \u2018actual\u2019 local extremum of the unconstrained space too.  e.g. in the illustration \u2014 take a non-kissing level line and then make the function start going down.  The constraint ring is draped over the level line and those points of inflection (the drape points) are maxima, but the tangents don\u2019t kiss. Don\u2019t match up.  Am I missing something?  Do we need to make sure there are no general local extrema in our constraint space before applying the above?  Or am I mis-visualizing?",

However, that is relatively rare that you can only plug it in this way. It is a bit deceptive because when you are doing good old 1st and 2nd derivative tests all the examples were ones you could solve this way so it gives the illusion of being common",

        "Comment": "@Dr. Trefor Bazett \n\nFirst off, let me express my deep gratitude about this great explanation. Many tutorials seem to skip important moments in explaining the geometric intuition behind the main equation of scalar multipliers.\n\nStill I have something unclear. \nWhen we say that the gradients of f and g have the same direction, it seems to imagine them lying in the same plane; and, this plane is the same where the contour line of f lies in. Isn't it like this?\n\nIf so, it is obvious that two vectors that lie in the same plane and  are perpendicular to the same straight line, then they are parallel one to another.\n\nBUT, the gradient of f in fact does not lie on the plane defined by contour line; it is a vector in 3D space (which, for instance, points to the top of hill).\n\nHow do we know that the gradient of g at the tangent point is parallel with the gradient of f?\n\nOr when you say that the contour line of f and the one of g are tangent, do you have in mind a common tangent line or a common tangent plane? \n\nYou show that real gradients in 3D are \"projected\" into 2D.  In other tutorials, people see just the ones in 2D and then the analysis that gradients are collinear is quite easy because the analysis about parallelism seems to be based on 2D, but as I mentioned above my concern is related to the fact that the real gradients we put in the equation are in 3D; hence showing their parallelism remains a bit unclear.\n\nIn other words, when we say that the gradient of f is perpendicular to f, that can be true even if the gradient does not lie on the plane defined by the contour line.\n\nCould you please shed more light on these \"paradoxes\" (which may be only my paradoxes) ?\n\nCould you please draw both gradients (for the f and g) on the graph of the left side?\n\nCould you please pick up two or more g functions?",

        "Comment": "Hi thanks for the explanation. What always confused me was the notion of the gradient of the constraint g(x). What I understand is the gradient is equivalent to the normal vector of the level curve g(x)=0 and can of course visualise this. And visualise why the normal of this and the gradient of the surface f(x) are scalar multiples. What I can't understand though is the gradient of g(x) when g(x)=0 is just a curve. How can a curve have a gradient. Or how can its corresponding surface g(x) (which doesn't exist) have a gradient. What exactly does del g(x) stand for.  If you understand what I'm saying.",

By mentioning here that the normals of f(x,y) and g(x,y) are scalar-related BECAUSE f and g share the same tangent line at each maximum/minimum point, this clarified a big question for me!\n\nAnother question I've had is: why do we set the constraint function g(x,y) equal to 0? That is, why do we throw everything on one side of the equation, leaving the other side with 0? Is it because taking the derivatives of both sides of the equation, if we arrange it in this way, will give a derivative, on the 0-side, of 0 anyway?",

In order to swap the integral and the summation signs, you need either:\n1) uniform convergence; this is the case, because the exponential series \u03a3 y^n /n! has a infinite radius, therefore UC, and even normal convergence is guaranted on [-1,0] or whatever interval (x ln x) spans;\n2) dominated convergence; on the interval [0,1], | x^x | = | exp(x lnx) | < 1 and \u222b 1 dx is well defined on [0..1] so it's ok;\n3) monotonous convergence; (x lnx)^n / n! < 0 so the series is strictly decreasing as n goes to \u221e, so it's ok.\nForgive me if I'm completely mistaken, because it's 1 AM, I just came back from a festival, I'm exhausted and I'm doing math, ah ah.",

        "Comment": "I did this in a relatively easier way, although not as rigorous.\nInt 0-1 (x^x)\nx^x is e^xln(x) which can be represented as\nSum(n=0,inf) of (x^n \u00d7 [ln x]^n)/n!\nIn this case the integral and summation signs can be swapped so you get\nInt 0-1 x^n \u00d7 (ln x)^n\nApplying integration by parts you get\n= -n/(n+1) Int(0-1) (x^n (ln x)^(n-1))\nDoing it again\n= n(n-1)/(n+1)^2 Int(0-1) (x^n (ln x)^(n-1)\nAnd by following the pattern you get\n(-1)^n\u00d7(n to the falling n power)/(n+1)^(n) \u00d7 (Int 0-1 x^n dx)\n\nThis simplifies to\n(-1)^n n!/(n+1)^n \u00d7 (1/(n+1))\n(-1)^n n!/(n+1)^(n+1)\n\nWhich when we plug into the summation becomes\n\nSum(n=0,inf) of ((-1)^n)/(n+1)^(n+1)\nWhich can also be rewritten as\n\nSum(1,inf) of (-(-n)^(-n))\n\nIt's easier though not as rigorous, as it makes an assumption about the pattern of the integral. However this assumption is easy to prove via induction, I just didn't wanna put that here cause it would take a little bit.",

Also, to do a convergence test before switching up the of integration and summation at first, doesn't harm anyone, and even though it is justified in the end, it would be more mathematically to do it first. But overall, it's a very good video. I enjoyed it very much.",

        "Comment": "WARNING: At 2:40, he replaces a function (e^xlnx) with its taylor series. This only works because the taylor series of e^x converges everywhere, so e^f(x) converges everywhere for all functions f(x). However, if you try to do this with a function whose interval of convergence does not cover the interval of integration, then you end up integrating with the a different function outside the interval of convergence than what you started with",

        "Comment": "Hello everyone! I might be kinda late, but here's my generalized approach for limits from a to b, being both real numbers. When Dr.Treffor said right before trying to get the gamma function for the answer that you can integrate by parts x^n*ln(x)^n, you can and the formula for the series that will appear is actually easy but a headache to get: \u03a3 (0=k to n) of (x^(n+1)ln(x)^(n-k)*(-1)^k*n!)/((n+1)^(k+1)*(n-k)!). You guys can plug in the values for the summatory and will see how they work. Finally, we can use the Taylor series of e^x to get a generalized integral which can be evaluated from a to b. We get \u03a3 (n=0 to inf) of (1/(n!)*(the aforementioned summatory)). Then just use Barrow's law.\n\nDespite it is theoretically correct and perfectly usable, for a computer to evaluate it the summatory will have an error because, obviously, the limit will be a real number and not infinity, not to mention evaluating it manually. Thus, I'd like that the ones that have an extended knowledge in the field can tell me whether it is plausible for the formula to be simplified in some way or method.",

If the integral of 1/x^x from 0 to 1 is the summation of 1/n^2, then it equals pi^2/6 which is about 1.645...but the integral is about 1.2913, and\n2. if the integral of x^sqr(x) from 0 to 1 is the summation you show, then it equals the Catalan constant (about 0.9160), but the integral is about 0.6586.\nNice video though!

Did a sum of that column, divided the result by 10000. Equals: 0,783430521.Studied engineering degree. Still do not understand ANYTHING from 2:41 onwards. Then I saw the result of the video.

I dont feel like leaving properties or theorems for students to find on their own is particularly useful when the work is relatively new to the students. Feel like it rarely had the desired effect and instead led to a lot of acceptance of mathematical facts without knowing why, a teaching practice which is holistically frowned upon in mathematics",

You don't think students have enough work to do without being left to piece together theorems and properties from work that is relatively new to them (the entire concept of 'proofs' was a very new thing to myself in my maths degree)? Challenging students to discover for themselves is a great tool when used correctly, but was totally abused by professors during my own degree experience. It came across that they clearly prioritised their other work and research over lecturing and used this \"leave this to you as an exercise\" as a mere shortcut so that they didn't have to bother spending any more time elaborating. Most of what they asked us to prove on our own as students we were not capable of and they rarely provided solutions for those who were unsure. Myself and many others had to resort to online tutorials and lectures over our own professors.",

        "Comment": "I admit I like to think about the way interections within the function suggest limitations on them. For example consider this, the existence of the power rule for derivatives seems to suggest that for whole number all odd slope that are on a x of odd power will have come from a fraction and that for a whole number c that could represent any number, there is potentiolly a limit on  how low it can actually be if all numbers are whole due to how power will keep multiplying up.  I have a 44 page paper on the collatz conjecture, but my record of passing math classes is admittily not perfect due to several issues with hand writing and expression of knowledge on tests themselves... your channel is always a good reminder for fun. Sometimes difficult to find less known rules that you discover yourself but that makes it interesting until you want to confirm they exist already lol XD",

Once we realized that Calculus is Algebra with limits, mostly Algebra, it became much easier. \nJust remember that the endpoints of an integral are not included in the value, because it's ultimately a limit operation. \nUsing a program to evaluate something like 0^0 is just accepting a definition, they simply define 0^0 to be 1. Computers are detrimental to understanding.",

I do have a small comment though, at 2:24, when you do the animation from \\ln x^x to x\\ln x, I am worried that some who are just curious but not familiar with maths will think that's the general rule to handle logarithm function. Something I noticed need to pay more attention to when teaching students that are not as proficient in maths",

I dont get how we can build a taylor series from that so that any derivative at particular value in the series becomes 1, and we get neat expression xlnx^n/n!\nPrecisely i dont get how ((e^(alna))^(n)*(xlnx-a)^n)/n! taylor series n member can become ((xlnx)^n)/n!",

You can't swap the sum and integral if the bounds of integration extend beyond the radius of convergence since this pretty much guarantees the resulting solution will not converge.",

        "Comment": "It's interesting but there is a simple reason! Taking the derivative of x, we find it to be ln x+1(x^x). Now if we set it to 0 and since here 0^0=1, we see (ln x+1)(x^x) is attained when ln x=-1, so x=e^(-1)=1/e. We can verify it is a minimum by checking if f''(1/e)>0: d((ln x+1)(x^x))/dx=(ln x+1)(ln x+1)(x^x)+(1/x)(x^x)={x^(x-1)}{(ln x+1)^2+1} (feel free to correct errors!)\nWe see this as a local minimum as when x=1/e, it turns out to be (1/e)^((1-e)/e), which is positive.",

So in some sense, there's nothing wrong with physicists omitting the justification. They just have to understand that what they've done is found a plausible answer to the question they're asking, but without a proof of the correctness of that answer. Unfortunately, a lot of physics types don't really get and/or worry about these kinds of \"subtle\" distinctions, despite that they're obviously important, and actually not very subtle at all.",

For example integral(1/x - 1/x from 0 to 1) (which is obviously zero) is not equal to integral(1/x from 0 to 1) - integral(1/x from 0 to 1), which is not defined (it's infinity minus infinity). Integral(f+g) equals integral(f) + integral (g) iff functions f, g, and f+g are all integrable. In the case of an infinite summation, you have deeper problems. If all functions are integrable and the sum of them is absolutely converging, you can switch the order. Else, you need to be more careful.",

You need absolute convergence of the FUNCTIONS involved, not just of the INTEGRALS. In general, of course, integrals and sums always commute in practice, the cases where they don't are highly artificial, but if you're going to talk about it, get it right.",

        "Comment": "Thanks for this beautiful solution to the Bernoulli integral \u222b\u2080\u00b9x\u02e3dx.\n\nJust a small point about the value of 0\u2070. At the start of the video you mentioned the apparent contradiction between the rules x\u2070=1 and 0\u02e3=0, and wondered which rule should take priority when x=0.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, the x\u2070=1 rule definitely takes priority. \nThis is because it is valid for all real x\u22600, whilst the 0\u02e3=0 rule, on the other hand, only applies for x>0, with 0\u02e3 being undefined for x<0.\n\nMy (very intuitive & handwaving) take on the function 0\u02e3 is that for x>0 it is 0, for x<0 it is \u221e, and so for x=0 it should be 1 (in some sense \"midway\" between 0 & \u221e). This view can be made a little more rigorous by considering the family of functions f\u2090(x)=a\u02e3 for a>0. If we let a\u21920 and take the pointwise limit of these functions, we get 0 for x>0, 1 for x=0 and \u221e for x<0. So we do indeed get the function 0\u02e3, on the understanding that it is undefined where the limiting value is infinite. \n\nThis way, I see no contradiction between the behaviour of x\u2070 and 0\u02e3 at 0 - both lead to 0\u2070=1.\n\nThe only apparent down side is that 0\u02e3 is discontinuous at x=0, which may seem bad, but we must remember that 0\u02e3 is a very \"singular\" exponential function - the only function a\u02e3 that can't be expressed in the form exp(x ln a), and I think we can then live with this discontinuity. \n\nMoreover, we must distinguish between 0\u2070 as a number (it is 1) and 0\u2070 as an indeterminate limit (it is indeed indeterminate in this case). \n\nOf course, the advantages of defining 0\u2070=1 are well-known and well documented (see, for example, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_zero ). My argument is not meant to compete with these in any way, just to respond in an intuitively satisfying way to the apparent contradiction between those two rules which probably convinces every school child (and probably many teachers) that 0\u2070 should be left undefined, just like 0/0.",

It is the basis of BriTheMathGuy's video \"The Most Controversial Number in Math\" (https://youtu.be/jNhjB4UfR9A ).\n\nAnother excellent argument (but probably too abstract to be understood by non-Mathematicians) is the map counting argument: if A and B are finite sets with cardinality m and n respectively, then the number of maps A\u2192B (essentially, the number of m-tuples with values in B), written B\u1d2c, has cardinality b\u1d43. This rule is certainly true if A and B are not both empty, so it is logical to extend it to that case also. There is exactly one map \u2205\u2192\u2205, and that is the empty map \u2205. So we get 0\u2070=1.",

        "Comment": "@@bozzigmupp510 You can write a wide variety of things under the sigma. For instance, if you want to sum up the sum square of all divisors of a number n, then you put Sigma d^2, and under the sigma, you write d|n. The space under the sigma is to specify the set that the variable or variables are running through. The most common thing is when the summation runs through a set of consecutive integers. As this is so common, it has a special notation: if the variable is t, and it runs between 3 and 20, you put t=3 below the sigma and 20 above the sigma. But of course, you have to indicate the proper variable: if the variable is t, don't put i=3 below the sigma.",

I\u2019m citing without stating it a consequence of Fubini\u2019s theorem that if the sum of the integral of |f_n| converges, then you can interchange the sum and integral without absolute values. In our case the absolute value can be taken before or after the integral because the f_n is either all negative or all positive on our interval of study in this example, but you are absolutely right that it isn\u2019t generally true to do it with the absolute value on the outside of the integral.",

        "Comment": "Another clever way to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1 of x^n*(ln(x))^n w.r.t. x is to use Feynman's trick, i.e. differentiation under the integral sign, a special case of the Leibniz integral rule. Start with the integral I(t), defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of x^t w.r.t. x, with t being a nonnegative continuous variable. I(t) is the first and easiest integral anyone learns in calculus, evaluating to 1/(t+1) after applying the reverse power rule and the Fundamental theorem of calculus. Next notice that, upon differentiation w.r.t. t and exchanging the integral and derivative operators (the derivative becoming a partial derivative under the integral sign), that I'(t) is the integral from 0 to 1 of x^t*ln(x) w.r.t. x. So differentiating I(t) once chains out a single factor of ln(x). This pattern continues, meaning I''(t) is the integral from 0 to 1 of x^t*(ln(x))^2 w.r.t. x, I'''(t) is the integral from 0 to 1 of x^t*(ln(x))^3 w.r.t. x, and so on, since d/dt(x^t) = x^t*ln(x) and ln(x) is a constant with respect to t. Therefore, differentiating I(t) n times and evaluating at t = n returns the integral in question, so I^(n)(n) is the integral from 0 to 1 of x^n*(ln(x))^n w.r.t. x. To evaluate I^(n)(t), look back at I(t). Since I(t) = 1/(t+1), I^(n)(t) = d^n/dt^n(1/(t+1)). Now a seemingly difficult problem of integration has been transformed into a rather simple problem of differentiation. To evaluate this nth derivative, look at the derivative for the first few values of n and try to recognize a pattern. I^(0)(t) = 1/(t+1) = (-1)^0*0!/(t+1)^(0+1), I^(1)(t) = -1/(t+1)^2 = (-1)^1*1!*1/(t+1)^(1+1), I^(2)(t) = 2/(t+1)^3 = (-1)^2*2!*1/(t+1)^(2+1), I^(3)(t) = -6/(t+1)^4 = (-1)^3*3!*1/(t+1)^(3+1)... , the pattern continuing on up to I^(n)(t), suggesting that I^(n)(t) = (-1)^n*n!/(t+1)^(n+1), which can be proved by induction. Finally, evaluating I^(n)(t) at t = n gives the desired result: I^(n)(n) = (-1)^n*n!/(n+1)^(n+1). Some lessons to take away from this solution are 1) that recognizing and exploiting patterns can be very helpful when solving math problems and 2) starting with a similar-looking problem that you know how to solve can often provide some insight into the solution of a more difficult problem. As an aside, this method of differentiation under the integral sign can equivalently be used to prove that Gamma(n+1) = n!, giving a greater intution as to why this technique gives the same result as that of this video, but I will leave that up to you!",

        "Comment": "TYPO 1: I got a bit silly with whether my index variable is called i or n. It doesn't matter, it just needs to be the same throughout!\nTYPO 2: At 6:30 I use a power rule (a^b)^c=a^(bc). However, I should have make it explicit that there is brackets around all of e^(-u). \nClarification: The key trick in solving this integral was writing the integrand as a power series and then interchanging the integral and the summation. If the sum of the integral of the absolute value of a sequence of functions converges, then we can do this interchange (this is a consequence of Fubini's Theorem). In our case, the integrands are either all positive or all negative, depending on n, so taking absolute values is equivalent to removing the negative signs in the resulting series which we can show converges via the ratio test. This justifies the interchange.",
